The `PodigeeEmbedKit` framework allows you to display information about a podcast hosted on [podigee.com](https://podigee.com) in your iOS, macOS or tvOS app. You can get data for the most recent published episode, a specific episode and even a playlist of all published episodes.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+ / Mac OS X 10.10+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+
- Xcode 10.0+

## Installation

### Dependency Managers
<details>
  <summary><strong>CocoaPods</strong></summary>

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate PodigeeEmbedKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'PodigeeEmbedKit', :git => 'https://github.com/podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit.git', :branch => 'master'
```

You have to link to the Github repository directly, because it is not publically available in the Cocoapods directory.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Carthage</strong></summary>

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PodigeeEmbedKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit" ~> 0.0.1
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Swift Package Manager</strong></summary>

To use PodigeeEmbedKit as a [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) package just add the following in your Package.swift file.

``` swift
// swift-tools-version:4.2

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "HelloPodigeeEmbedKit",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "HelloPodigeeEmbedKit", dependencies: ["PodigeeEmbedKit"])
    ]
)
```
</details>

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate PodigeeEmbedKit into your project manually.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Git Submodules</strong></summary><p>

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

```bash
$ git init
```

- Add PodigeeEmbedKit as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- Open the new `PodigeeEmbedKit` folder, and drag the `PodigeeEmbedKit.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

    > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Select the `PodigeeEmbedKit.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- You will see two different `PodigeeEmbedKit.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `PodigeeEmbedKit.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.

    > It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from.

- Select the `PodigeeEmbedKit.framework`.

- And that's it!

> The `PodigeeEmbedKit.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.

</p></details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Embedded Binaries</strong></summary><p>

- Download the latest release from https://github.com/podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit/releases
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- Add the downloaded `PodigeeEmbedKit.framework`.
- And that's it!

</p></details>

## Usage

When you request data you always have to provide the domain of the podcast hosted on Podigee. The domain format is `podcast-specific-subdomain.podigee.io`, e.g. `podcast-news.podigee.io`.

### Request embed data for the most recent episode

Requesting embed data returns

* Podcast Metadata
* Episode Metadata
* Extension settings

If you do not define a specific episode this will return metadata for the most recently published episode of this podcast.

```swift
  let podcastDomain = "podcast-news.podigee.io"
  PodigeeEmbedKit.embedDataForPodcastWith(domain: podcastDomain) { (podcastEmbed, error) in
      let podcastTitle = podcastEmbed?.podcast.title
      let episode = podcastEmbed?.episode
      let episodeTitle = episode?.title
      let mp3Url = episode?.media.mp3
  }
```

The `podcastEmbed` struct which is returned is defined like this:

```swift
public struct PodcastEmbed: Codable {
    public let episode: Episode?
    public let podcast: Podcast
    public let extensions: Extensions
}
```

Extensions include several boolean toggles which can be defined in the Podigee webinterface for external player embeds. Using these settings you can define if the player should show a download button, or the chapter marks for example. It is up to you to use these toggles to actually have an effect on your UI.

Please [take a look at the full API documentation]() for more information.

### Request embed data for specific episode

You can also request embed information for a specific episode of a podcast. In this case you have to provide the `episodePath` in addidation to the podcast domain. In this case the path to the episode is `7-podcatcher-in-the-rye`.

```swift
  PodigeeEmbedKit.embedDataForPodcastWith(domain: "podcast-news.podigee.io", episodePath: "7-podcatcher-in-the-rye", complete: { (podcastEmbed, error) in
      let title = podcastEmbed?.episode?.title
      let subtitle = podcastEmbed?.episode?.subtitle
      let number = podcastEmbed?.episode?.number
  })
```

### Request a list of published episodes

You can also request a list of published episodes. By default this returns the last 10 episodes of the podcast sorted by publish date.

```swift
  PodigeeEmbedKit.playlistForPodcastWith(domain: "podcast-news.podigee.io", complete: { (playlist, error) in
      let episodes = playlist.episodes
      for episode in episodes {
        print(episode.title)
      }
  })
```

**Paging**

If you need more episodes you can use the paging parameters `pageSize` and `offset` to request episodes using multiple requests.

```swift
  // fetch first 5 episodes
  PodigeeEmbedKit.playlistForPodcastWith(domain: "podcast-news.podigee.io", pageSize: 5, offset: 0, complete: { (playlist, error) in
      let episodes = playlist.episodes
  })

  // fetch next 5 episodes
  PodigeeEmbedKit.playlistForPodcastWith(domain: "podcast-news.podigee.io", pageSize: 5, offset: 5, complete: { (playlist, error) in
    let episodes = playlist.episodes
  })
```

The returned episodes count only matches the requested `pagesSize` if the podcast does have enough published episodes.

**Sorting**

Episodes can either be sorted by publish date or by episode number. If you do not set the sorting algorithm yourself the episodes are sorted by publish date by default.

```swift
  PodigeeEmbedKit.playlistForPodcastWith(domain: "podcast-news.podigee.io", sortBy: .episodeNumber, complete: { (playlist, error) in
      let episodes = playlist.episodes
  })
```
